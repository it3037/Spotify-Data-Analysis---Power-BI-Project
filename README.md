## üìà Key DAX Measures Used

### ‚úÖ 1. Default Rate by Employment Type (%)
```dax
Default Rate by Employment type (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Loan_default'), 'Loan_default'[Default] = 1, ALLEXCEPT('Loan_default', 'Loan_default'[EmploymentType])),
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Loan_default'), ALLEXCEPT('Loan_default', 'Loan_default'[EmploymentType])),
    0
) * 100
```

### ‚úÖ 2. YoY Loan Amount Change (%)
```dax
YoY Loan Amount Change (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM('Loan_default'[LoanAmount]), 'Loan_default'[Year] = MAX('Loan_default'[Year]))
    - CALCULATE(SUM('Loan_default'[LoanAmount]), 'Loan_default'[Year] = MAX('Loan_default'[Year]) - 1),
    CALCULATE(SUM('Loan_default'[LoanAmount]), 'Loan_default'[Year] = MAX('Loan_default'[Year]) - 1),
    0
) * 100
```

### ‚úÖ 3. YoY Default Loan Count Change (%)
```dax
YOY Default Loans Change (%) =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Loan_default'), 'Loan_default'[Default] = 1, 'Loan_default'[Year] = MAX('Loan_default'[Year]))
    - CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Loan_default'), 'Loan_default'[Default] = 1, 'Loan_default'[Year] = MAX('Loan_default'[Year]) - 1),
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Loan_default'), 'Loan_default'[Default] = 1, 'Loan_default'[Year] = MAX('Loan_default'[Year]) - 1),
    0
) * 100
```

### ‚úÖ 4. YTD Loan Amount
```dax
YTD Loan Amount = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Loan_default'[LoanAmount]),
    DATESYTD('Loan_default'[Loan Date (DD/MM/YYYY)]),
    ALLEXCEPT('Loan_default', 'Loan_default'[Credit Score bins], 'Loan_default'[MaritalStatus])
)
```

### ‚úÖ 5. Age Group Categorization
```dax
Age Group = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'Loan_default'[Age] >= 13 && 'Loan_default'[Age] <= 19, "Teen",
    'Loan_default'[Age] >= 20 && 'Loan_default'[Age] <= 39, "Adult",
    'Loan_default'[Age] >= 40 && 'Loan_default'[Age] <= 59, "Middle Adult",
    'Loan_default'[Age] >= 60, "Senior Citizen",
